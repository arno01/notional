# Sentries

OMFG wow we are going to document our sentry node setup in detail!


* 8 or more cpu cores (not dual cpu, not ever)
* 128 to 256 gb ram
* Pcie4.0 nvme drives
* unlimited bandwidth
* Arch Linux

* We are okay with building these machines and shipping them (this is called hosting and if we rent the machines it's called leasing) honestly we don't care much which but have to make a price evaluation.
  * We want four points of presence in vietnam
    * two datacenters in Hanoi
      * lanit.vn
      * (maybe viettel idc)
    * one datacenter in Da Nang or Nha Trang
    * one in HCMC
  * we will expand our footprint inside the four.  We will do this for years and want to have good and smooth relationships.      
* known peering (we should know the AS number, I already know lanit.vn's)
* phone numbers for datacenters in this document


TODO:

Long:
  * get datacenter quotes for leasing and hosting and put them directly into this file. 


# Details:
* hosting cost is cheaper but requires lots of deposit.
