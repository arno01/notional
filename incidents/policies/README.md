#Incident Processes

## Fraud or Scam Detected <a name="fraudsandscams"></a>

Notional considers any of the following to be fraud/scam behavior:
* Purposeful misdirection (especially regarding token prices/value) by project founders or leaders
* Technical acts/code/behavior designed (whether by timing and coordination, or malicious code execution, or other means) to enrich project founders/leaders at the expense of a blockchain community or general cosmos ecosystem.
* False or impossible claims of any type in order to raise funds

As there seems to be no end to the imagination of fraudsters, this is not an exhaustive list.  

### Fraud/Scam response proceeedure
1. The structure of the fraud/scam should be documented along with evidence.
2. If notional has been brought into the affected project, all work is immediately suspended upon receipt of evidence.  
3. Notional will evaluate the evidence and it's impact.  We will attempt to notify affected parties in the best way we can determine in order to minimize losses or give the "good guys" a chance to fix the issues if possible.  
4. Notional will pass/publish publicly the evidence once either a week has passed or mitigation efforts are successful.  Notional is not bound to this week long waiting period however, we reserve the right to do whatever we feel is best for the overall community.
5. If all issues are resolved, work *may* resume.  Otherwise, Notional will terminate all work on the fraudulent project permanently.

Other notes: Notional will not comment publicly beyond documenting the evidence it has discovered with any required explanations.

## Software Security Vulnerability <a name="vulnerability"></a>

Software security vulnerabilities include issues with Tendermint or other layer-1 chain software, issues with IBC, issues with smart contracts, or possible attack vectors such as DOS.

If Notional Labs discovers a potential security vulnerability, we will take the following actions.

1. Test and validate that the security vulnerability exists, along with sample code.
2. Pass the findings, complete with sample code, to top project stakeholders.
3. Wait a minimum of 1 week before publishing findings, in cooperation with project stakeholders. This waiting period will be waived if we feel that the security vulnerability is part of an attempted scam/fraud (see above).
4. Once the vulnerability has been patched, publish our methods and code the community to help others look for and fix similar vulnerabilities in the future.
